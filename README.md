# Tuning LLMs for Code Generation

## <u>Use-Cases for LLMs</u>

1. ##### Code Completion
   - Similar to autocomplete on GithubCopilot
2. ##### Code Documentation
   - LLMs can generate comments and documentation for existing code bases. 
3. ##### Bug Detection and Correction
   - By understanding the syntax and semantics of programming languages, LLMs can identify potential bugs or errors in code.
4. ##### Code Translation
   - LLMs will translate code from one language to another
5. ##### Semantic Code Search
   - LLMs can help developers find code snippets that meet certain functional requirements, even if the exact keywords are not used in the query.

# <u>*Fine-Tuning versus Prefix-Tuning*</u>

##### Fine-Tuning:

- Adjusting the weights of a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to specialize its performance.

- Requires a substantial amount of task-specific data.

- Involves high computational cost as all model parameters are updated during training.

- Creates a new model specific to each task, lacking flexibility in handling multiple tasks without retraining.

- Generally achieves higher performance on specific tasks due to the extensive adaptation of the model.

##### Prefix-Tuning:

- Adding a task-specific continuous prefix to the input embeddings, influencing the generation of content without altering the pre-trained model's weights.

- Needs less task-specific data compared to fine-tuning.

- Lower computational cost since only a small set of parameters (the prefixes) are learned.

- More flexible as different prefixes can be applied to the same model for different tasks without changing the underlying model.

- Offers competitive performance, particularly useful when adaptation with minimal data is required.
